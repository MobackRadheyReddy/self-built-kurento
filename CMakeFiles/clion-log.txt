CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindKurentoHelpers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "KurentoHelpers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "KurentoHelpers"
  with any of the following names:

    KurentoHelpersConfig.cmake
    kurentohelpers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "KurentoHelpers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "KurentoHelpers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "KurentoHelpers" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
